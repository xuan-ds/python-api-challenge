# APIWeatherPy

## This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## Part 1: WeatherPy
### In this deliverable, a Python script has been created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 

### a. Create Plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude.
### b. Compute Linear Regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

## Part 2: VacationPy
### In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations.

### a. Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame.
### b. Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.
### c. Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.
### d. For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
### e. Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
